Assignment 1: Basic OOP Concepts
Objective: Understand the basics of classes, objects, properties, and methods.

Task:

1. Create a JavaScript class called Person.
2. Add properties for name, age, and gender to the Person class.
3. Implement a method called introduce() in the Person class that returns a string introducing the person (e.g., "Hello, my name is [name], I am [age] years old.").
4. Create two instances of the Person class with different names, ages, and genders.
5. Call the introduce() method for each person and display their introductions.



Assignment 2: Simple Inheritance
Objective: Practice inheritance by creating subclasses.

Task:

1. Create a base class called Shape with a property type (e.g., "circle", "rectangle").
2. Create subclasses Circle and Rectangle that inherit from the Shape class.
3. Add properties specific to each subclass (radius for Circle and width & height for Rectangle).
4. Implement a method calculateArea() in each subclass that calculates and returns the area of the shape.
5. Create instances of both subclasses and display their types and areas.
